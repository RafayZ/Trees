The goal of this exercise is read data from a file (vegetationData.csv) containing global veg- etation density (percentage of area covered by trees) provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, Chiba University and collaborating organizations.
The file consists of over 4 million data points that have a coordinate in longitude (-180 to 180; west to east) and latitude (-90 to 90; south to north) and the percentage in tree cover at this location. See Wikipedia for an in-depth explanation.
Areas such as the ocean have a tree density value of 254. All other coordinates will have integer values between 0 and 100.
